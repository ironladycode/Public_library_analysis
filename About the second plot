In the second plot, I draw the scatterplot of "VISITS","Total Circulation transaction","Librarians with Master's degree",
and "Salary for the librarians".Interestingly, the more librarians with Master's degree, the more visits to the libraries. This
maybe due to the reason that people with higher degrees can better assist the visitors in some level, like the ability to 
explain library materials to visitors.The positive correlation between "visits" and â€œlibrarian salaries" also shows that higher 
librarians' salaries, better services, more visits.

In the next stage of my project, I am considering fitting different regression models with visits as the dependent variable, to
better explore the correlation.
