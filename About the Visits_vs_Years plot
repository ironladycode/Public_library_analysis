In the Visits_vs_year plot I plotted the average yearly visits VS different years(from 2006 to 2015) for four randomly choosen states.
From this plot,we can tell that the year factor plays an significant impact on the average visits, though different details
for different states. In the next stage of my project, I am going to explore what other factors have been changing with year, 
and their correlation with the visits amount.
