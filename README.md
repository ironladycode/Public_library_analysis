# Public_library_analysis
Public libraries have been providing good resouces to learn and develop. High amounts of visits to libraries could be a good sign for the stability and prosperity of the local community. I want to find out what factors and how such factors have been influncing the visit amounts, from both cross-section and time development points of view.
